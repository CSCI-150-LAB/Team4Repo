## Description

New students moving to college from somewhere else may be able to afford housing but do not have enough money to furnish it. Also, students who have graduated and are moving away need to get rid of their furniture either by selling it or throwing it away.
Our donation board aims to create a forum where students both arriving and leaving can donate furniture and other items students may find useful to other students.

## Objectives
**Admins**
* Moderate listings and check User feedback
    * Ensure they are not threats, fake, or scams
* Check Userâ€™s reports of a listing and feedback
* Verify/manage users
* Ban users, verify frequency donors,
* Create verified meeting zones for users to use
* A public list of meeting zones that are safe to use and possibly monitored by cameras
* Pin important posts that are relevant to the community on Class Board

**Users**
* Create listings of their donations
* Message listing creators (other Users) to schedule meetup time
* Give feedback about donors
    * Say whether the donor was friendly, the transaction was smooth or the donor/recipient failed to show up
* Create wish lists about things they need

**Class Board**
* Students can post about classes taken or upcoming college based events (Sport games, Seminars, etc.)
* Students can ask questions about courses to other students through posts
* Board posts are divided by course handles (CSCI - Computer Science, IT - Information Technology, PHYS - Physical Science)
    * Ex: [CSCI] Help with 150 lab2
